## Write the Problem Definition:

The Problem Definition is like a contract between the assignees and the customer(s). It defines a set of goals that everyone agrees on before starting the work. This should be saved in the SharePoint folder you setup in the previous section. As part of writing the PD, you will need to include:

* some background information about the area,
* what it is that needs to be solved,
* how we intend to solve the problem,
* any limitations and caveats if they exist,
* what tools and data we will use and
* any data governance considerations if they are applicable.

For sensitive data containing personally identifiable information (PII), you will need to get approval from the Information Governance (IG) team before you start the work. During this process, you will need to tell them what sensitive data you are using and how you intend to use it. Your critical friend and DALL team manager can assist with this process. For more information, please see the following page within the wiki [INSERT LINK].

For tips on writing the content of the PD, please see the DALL OneNote Wiki [INSERT LINK]. To make sure customers understand our plan, it's best to include a lot of details in the PD. If any further caveats are discovered during the work, it is important to add these to the PD and make the customer aware. If you need to do more work after starting the initiative, update the plan and tell the customer about the extra time needed. If you are unsure about any terms agreed within the PD, you can reach out to your critical friend or the DALL team manager for advice.

Throughout the process, your critical friend will review the PD to check if you understood the customer's request correctly, and if your plans to solve the problems are appropriate. Also, make sure to share the PD with the customer(s) to get their feedback, understand their business needs, and make sure you have addressed all their requests.

## Estimate Timescales:
During the planning stages of the initiative, it is a good idea to plan the timescales of the project. To plan effectively, create a Gannt chart. List the items and their completion times. Estimate when each element will be finished. Please see the Gannt chart template within the wiki for more information [INSERT LINK].

When planning any project, it is easy to underestimate the time required to complete it. You should always account for:

* other projects,
* upcoming planned leave,
* time spent in meetings per week,
* the hours you work per week,
* time spent learning about the project,
* time required to get access to tools and data and
* any other commitments.

If you add more tasks to the project, make sure to update the Gannt chart and inform the customer of the new deadlines. Your planned deadlines are usually just estimates and can be extended if underestimated.

## Data, Business Understanding and Further Research:
Given you have access to the data you need, you should start to interrogate it. During this process, you should keep a spreadsheet to document all anomalies, caveats, and quality issues so that you can communicate these to the customer. A good tip is document for each column:

* what it shows,
* how many missing records,
* any errors it includes and
* how it is calculated if applicable.

You can update the limitations section of the Problem Definition (PD). This will inform the customer of what is possible and not possible to achieve during the initiative. You might find other interesting avenues or datasets to explore that the customer didn't think about. In this case, it is important to discuss your ideas with them and see if they are worth pursuing.

It is a good idea to keep a list of all questions you have with the data, so that you can ask the customer about these to improve your knowledge. You can check JIRA and ask around to see if anyone has covered this data before to gain insights from them. Also, your critical friend or team manager can also assist you in understanding the data. If it is a new dataset, it is up to you explore and understand the dataset, with help from the customer who works within this area every day.

Finally, it is possible that other analytical teams within the BSA have worked with the data before and may be able to offer insight. The Management Information (MI) team produce a range of dashboards in a variety of areas. Also, the External Reporting team manage the ePACT2, eDEN and eOPS systems, which can be used to validate any findings you have in the prescriptions, dental or ophthalmic space respectively.

## Meet with the Customer:
After finishing your draft of the Problem Definition (PD), meet with the customer(s) to go through it together. Talk about any limitations or questions found during the data exploration and set the agreed outputs.

As an outcome of meeting, there may be additional things to explore or add to the PD before the customer can sign off. Therefore, it is important to repeat section 2 again until the customer is happy to proceed.

In rare cases, this meeting may highlight that the initiative may not be possible in the way that the customer initially intended. Unless any suitable alternatives are identified, we may need to give up on the project. In this case, you must discuss your concerns with the DALL team manager before communicating this with the customer.
