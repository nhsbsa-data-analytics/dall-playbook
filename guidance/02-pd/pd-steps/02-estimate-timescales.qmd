## Gannt Charts
During the planning stages of the initiative, it is a good idea to plan the timescales of the project. To plan effectively, create a Gannt chart. List the items and their completion times. Estimate when each element will be finished. Please see the Gannt chart template within the templates folder [here](https://nhsbsauk.sharepoint.com/sites/InsightTeam-DataAnalyticsLearningLabDALL/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FInsightTeam%2DDataAnalyticsLearningLabDALL%2FShared%20Documents%2FData%20Analytics%20Learning%20Lab%20%28DALL%29%2FDALL%2FDALL%20Initiatives%20CRISP%2DDM%2FTemplate%20Documents&p=true&ga=1).

When planning any project, it is easy to underestimate the time required to complete it. You should always account for:

* other projects,
* upcoming planned leave,
* time spent in meetings per week,
* the hours you work per week,
* time spent learning about the project,
* time required to get access to tools and data and
* any other commitments.

If you add more tasks to the project, make sure to update the Gannt chart and inform the customer of the new deadlines. Your planned deadlines are usually just estimates and can be extended if underestimated.
