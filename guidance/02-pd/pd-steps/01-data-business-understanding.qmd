Provided that you have access to the data you need, you should start to interrogate it by:

  - using a spreadsheet to document all anomalies, caveats, and quality issues
  - communicating data quality issues with the customer

Good data documentation could include:

  - a summary of what each column represents
  - the number of missing records
  - the number of errors
  - if applicable, the logic used to calculate the column

After interrogating the data you should:

- update the limitations section of the Problem Definition (PD)
- inform the customer of what is possible and not possible to achieve during the initiative
- discuss other interesting research questions with the customer and explore if these are worth pursuing

## Tips for gaining understanding
- It is a good idea to keep a list of all questions you have with the data.
- For further insight, check JIRA and ask around to see if anyone has explored this data before.
- The Critical friend and team manager can also provide assistance.

Finally, it is possible that other analytical teams within the BSA have worked with the data before and may be able to offer insight.

- The Management Information (MI) team produce a range of dashboards in a variety of areas.
- The External Reporting team manage the ePACT2 (prescriptions), eDEN (dental) and eOPS (ophthalmic) systems.
