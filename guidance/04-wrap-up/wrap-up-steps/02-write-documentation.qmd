Without good documentation, it is difficult for future projects to leverage our work.

- Make sure that all of your custom functions are described in detail.
- Consider replicating a similar structure to an R or Python package with each parameter explained, and examples of how to run the function.
- If using GitHub remember to update the README file.

At a minimum the GitHub README file should contain:

- The project name.
- A quick overview of the projectâ€™s purpose.

Also consider including:

- A summary of the project structure.
- Steps to reproduce your code.
- Key technologies and methods used in the project.
    
Remember to document anything that you tried that did not work.
