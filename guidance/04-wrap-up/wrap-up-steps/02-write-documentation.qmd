Documenting code is another crucial step that should not be ignored. Without good documentation, it is difficult for future projects to leverage our work. Make sure that all of your custom functions are described in detail. Consider replicating a similar structure to an R or Python package with each parameter explained, and examples of how to run the function.

If you have a GitHub repository, remember to update the README file. The README file should contain as a minimum the project name, and a quick overview of the projectâ€™s purpose. Including a summary of the project structure, steps to reproduce your code, and key technologies and methods used can be valuable. Writing a clear and informative README will increase the chances of others using your code. It will also help future users understand your project better.

Remember to document anything that you tried that did not work. This is good practice so that someone picking up your work in the future can avoid running into the same issues. The documentation can be included on SharePoint, the Git repository README file, and the DALL One Note Wiki.
