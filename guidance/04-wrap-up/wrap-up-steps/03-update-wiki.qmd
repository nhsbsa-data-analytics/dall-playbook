Throughout the initiative, you will have interrogated some data and potentially picked up some new skills in the process.

- If there is anything you found particularly useful or that could be beneficial for others- please add it to the DALL OneNote Wiki.
- If a question you have isn't already on the Wiki you should find the answer and incorporate it.

The Wiki should be the first place you look when you have questions on a:

- particular dataset
- piece of software
- type of analysis
