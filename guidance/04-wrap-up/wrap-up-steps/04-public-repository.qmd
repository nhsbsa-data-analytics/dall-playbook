Where applicable, we aim to generate reproducible code that is made open source. This is in line with guidance outlined in the [government service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open).

Before making a repository public, please consider the following:

  - **your git commit history will be made public**
  - git messages can be changed but it is advised that you follow good commit practice
  - each commit should be limited to a single change
  - commit history can be removed but it is not recommended as we strive to be transparent
  
**Make sure that you never push data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the GitHub repository.**

  - use Git Leaks to reduce the risk of pushing PII to Git
  - never write PII directly in R scripts
  - always reference PII from the database
