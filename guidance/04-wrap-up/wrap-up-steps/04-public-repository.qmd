Where applicable, we aim to generate reproducible code that is made open source. This is in line with guidance outlined in the [government service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open).

Before making a repository public, please consider the following:

1. Your git commit history will be made public.
  - Git messages can be changed but it is advised that you follow good commit practice.
  - Each commit should be limited to a single change.
  - Commit history can be removed but it is not recommended as we strive to be transparent. 
  
2. Make sure that you never push data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the GitHub repository.
  - Use Git Leaks to reduce the risk of pushing PII to Git.
  - Never write PII directly in R scripts.
  - Always reference PII from the database.
