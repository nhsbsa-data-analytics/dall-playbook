Where applicable, we aim to generate reproducible code that is made open source. This is in line with guidance outlined in the [government service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open). Before making a repository public, please consider the following:

1. Your git commit history will be made public. Although commit messages can be changed, it is advised that you adopt a good commit practice throughout. Each commit message should be limited to a single change and not large chunks of code. Whilst it is possible to recreate the repository without a commit history this should not be used in place of a good commit history.

2. Make sure that you never push data or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to the GitHub repository. An easy example of something that could be overlooked is an NHS number. If you test a chunk of code by looking at a single individual it is easy for the NHS number to be forgotten about. Itâ€™s even easier to miss if the PII is part of some test code that has been commented out. Git Leaks can help find subtle examples and reduce the risk of uploading personal information to GitHub.
