- Cleaning your project is an equally important step as the modelling and analysis.
- Leaving a messy project folder and code can lead to difficulties later down the line.
- It is important that you dedicate enough time to completing this step.
- Approach the project clean up as a serious and worthwhile endeavour- it can be useful for future project.

## General Considerations

- Work with the mindset that all work could be make public.
- Small and precise commits are better than large ones.
- Maintain a clear project structure with clean scripts.
- Separate data, scripts and output into their own sub-directories.
- Move custom functions into their own script.
- Delete stale git branches or merge them into main.
- Streamline the codebase.
- Create a config file with key parameters and filters that are reference throughout the project.
- Identify bottlenecks and optimise the code.
- Ensure key tables within the database are available to the wider team.
- A common location to store the tables is the DALL_REF schema.
- Remove personal tables from your own database schema after the project has concluded.
- This is especially important for person identifiable information.
