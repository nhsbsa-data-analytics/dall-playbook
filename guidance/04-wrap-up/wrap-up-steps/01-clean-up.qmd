- Cleaning your project is an equally important step as the modelling and analysis.
- Leaving a messy project folder and code can lead to difficulties later down the line.
  - Delete old files that are no longer needed for the project.
  - Delete data tables from personal schemas when no longer required.
- It is important that you dedicate enough time to completing this step.
- Approach the project clean up as a serious and worthwhile endeavour. 
- It can be useful for a future project.

## General considerations

- Delete stale git branches or merge them into main.
- Create a config file with key parameters and filters that are referenced throughout the project.
- Ensure key tables within the database are available to the wider team, if applicable.

Please refer to the internal Data Science Wiki for more information on cleaning your code.
