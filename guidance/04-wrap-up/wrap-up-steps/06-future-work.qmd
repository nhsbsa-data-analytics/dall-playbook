Now that the project has ended you may have explored or wanted to explore areas that were beyond the scope of the initiative. Be sure to add these ideas to the DALL ideas register located on SharePoint [INSERT LINK]. If there is not enough for a full initiative, the ideas could always be undertaken as a three-week exploratory project.
