Not all Github repositories will be made public. But if you need to make it public then there are a few things you should consider:

1.	Your git commit history will be made public. Although commit messages can be changed it is advised that you adopt a good commit practice throughout. Try to limit each commit to a single change and not large chunks of code.  

2.	Make sure that you never push data or PID to the GitHub repository. An easy example of something that could be overlooked is an NHS number. If you test a chunk of code by looking at a single individual it is easy for the NHS number to be forgotten about. Itâ€™s even easier to miss if the PID is part of some test code that has been commented out. Using something like Git Leaks is a useful tool to help capture some of these subtle examples and minimise the risk of uploading personal information to GitHub.

More information on creating a public Github repository can be found on the DALL Wiki (Coding & Dashboards > GitHub > DALL standard practice).
