## Role of a critical friend

The critical friend is an integral part of the team. They serve as someone to bounce ideas off, offer advice and act as another pair of eyes and ears that may pick up up on something unnoticed by the rest of the team. So keep them in the loop as much as possible by asking them to review things before taking anything to the customer of the initiative.

The critical friend should review the process, code and outputs of the team. This should be done before asking the initiative customer to review the outputs. The ask is always "be as thorough as you can", but other commitments can make a thorough review challenging. So, where possible, give the critical friend advance notice that you expect to be ready for their review soon.

At a minimum, the critical friend should be

- Pulling code to their local environment and running it
- Reading supporting text and commenting on it where they are unsure of something, believe a mistake is there or have a suggestion
- Checking the outputs against the problem definition and calling out any discrepancies

## Flexible reviewing

Since the critical friend will be working on other initiatives, it can be challenging to coordinate reviews. So we should do things in a way that is as flexible as possible, while also keeping on top of any timescales promised. One way to promote this is to make it possible for the critical friend to review work in progress.

GitHub allows for the creation of draft pull requests (PRs). By using these at the beginning of a review cycle, and ensuring to always check our work into GitHub at least daily, the work can be reviewed when it is convenient. Some may prefer to dip in and out to fit around other commitments, while others would prefer to review things only when fully developed.
