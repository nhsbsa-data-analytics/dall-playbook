Reviewing work and outputs frequently should be done throughout the initiative life cycle. There are multiple layers of review.

- Self Review
- Team Review
- Critical Friend Review
- Customer Review

In response to any one of these reviews, it may be deemed necessary to go back to data prep, analysis or drafting of outputs.

## Self Review

Review your own work as you go, but especially before requesting anyone else to review it.

- Check for errors
- Run code with a 'clean slate' to ensure there are no dependencies in your local environment that will not be there later
- If you are testing adhoc, save your effort by writing a repeatable test
- Document your code
- Once happy with your code create a pull request (PR) on Github
- Check the code diff on Github and add comments to explain to a code reviewer any decisions you made that are not obvious
- Checking the diff often highlights something you missed; in these cases make further changes and push them
- Once happy with your PR, request that someone code review it
- Prefer smaller pull requests to huge ones
- Remember that your colleagues have other work; give them enough time to review your work properly

## Team Review

One or more other members of the initiative team should review all code and outputs before it is merged into the main branch.

- Reviewer should pull the code into their local environment, and run it from a 'blank slate' state
- Reviewer should add comments and suggestions to the PR
- Reviewer should check any outputs match what was agreed in the problem definition
- If something does not make sense, ask the code author to clarify
- If reviewer has more than a few questions, organise a call with the code author and work through the PR together

## Critical Friend Review

The initiative critical friend (CF) should be asked for feedback on work in progress at frequent intervals, and always before asking a customer to look at it.

- The CF should put themselves in the shoes of the customer when reviewing outputs
- The CF should put themselves in the shoes of someone tasked with using the code base when reviewing code
- Depending on the amount or complexity of any feedback, CF should arrange a call with the initiative team to discuss

## Customer Review

The customer should be given frequent opportunities to see work in progress.

- Send them drafts of the outputs to review in their own time, rather than only sharing your screen in a call
- Be open to having calls once they have reviewed the work
- Discuss any questions or suggestions they have
- You will (hopefully!) have a call where the customer agrees that everything in scope, as per the problem definition, is done
- Arrange a final call with the customer to present the work
- Ensure the customer is happy they understand how to use any interactive elements, such as dashboards
- Can discuss any potential for future related work
