Reviewing work and outputs frequently should be done throughout the initiative life cycle. There are multiple layers of review:

- Self Review
- Team Review
- Critical Friend Review
- Customer Review

In response to any one of these reviews, it may be deemed necessary to go back to data preparation, analysis or drafting of outputs.

## Self review
Review your own work as you go, but especially before requesting anyone else to review it.

- check for errors
- run code with a 'clean slate' to ensure there are no dependencies in your local environment that will not be there later
- if you are testing adhoc, save your effort by writing a repeatable test
- document your code
- once happy with your code create a pull request (PR) on Github
- check the code diff (difference) on Github and add comments to explain to a code. reviewer any decisions you made that are not obvious
- checking the code diff often highlights something you missed; in these cases make further changes and push them
- once happy with your PR, request that someone code review it
- prefer smaller pull requests to larger ones
- remember that your colleagues have other work; give them enough time to review your work properly

## Team review
One or more other members of the initiative team should review all code and outputs before it is merged into the main branch.

- reviewer should pull the code into their local environment, and run it from a 'blank slate' state
- reviewer should add comments and suggestions to the PR
- reviewer should check any outputs match what was agreed in the problem definition
- if something does not make sense, ask the code author to clarify
- if reviewer has more than a few questions, organise a call with the code author and work through the PR together

## Critical friend review
The initiative critical friend (CF) should be asked for feedback on work in progress at frequent intervals, and always before asking a customer to look at it.

- the CF should put themselves in the shoes of the customer when reviewing outputs
- the CF should put themselves in the shoes of someone tasked with using the code base when reviewing code
- depending on the amount or complexity of any feedback, CF should arrange a call with the initiative team to discuss

## Customer review
The customer should be given frequent opportunities to see work in progress.

- send them drafts of the outputs to review in their own time, rather than only sharing your screen in a call
- be open to having calls once they have reviewed the work
- discuss any questions or suggestions they have

When you feel the initiative is completed, you should have a call with the customer to present your findings. 

- ensure the customer is happy they understand how to use any interactive elements, such as dashboards
- discuss any potential for future related work
