In this step, we turn our data into insights. The work done here can vary. It can include small data extraction jobs, creating reports and dashboards, and deploying machine learning models. The analysis or modelling you conduct is also heavily reliant on the outputs you agreed with the customer. Also, the way in which the initiative is carried out will naturally vary from person to person, depending on your preferences of programming languages and output style.

## Conducting the Work
The 'typical' DALL initiative usually involves some initial data preparation in the previous step, done in SQL. Then, the output base table(s) are loaded into R or Python. Good coding practices, like using GitHub issues and branches and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), are followed to conduct the work. Please see the DALL OneNote Wiki for more information on these [INSERT LINK].

For some very small initiatives, it may be appropriate to extract some summary figures and use Excel to plot some simple graphs for the customer. R is often used for analytical reports that are run infrequently. This is because it has advanced visualisation features and can easily show results using R markdown and Shiny. Python is often used for machine learning because it has many libraries and works well with cloud-based products. Finally, visualisation products such as Power BI may be appropriate, given the customer has access. Dashboards are great when data needs to be frequently updated, and customers want to analyse the data themselves. These choices are personal preference, and you may use whichever you think is appropriate. For tips on each of these tools, please see the DALL OneNote Wiki [INSERT LINK].

## Check the Quality
Just like before, it's important to test and validate your results. Use previous DALL initiatives, MI dashboards, and ePACT2 for prescription-based outputs, if available. You will talk about your results with your colleagues and the customer during the review section. Finally, do not include sensitive information in your results or code unless asked for. A good tip here is to always assume that your code will be made publicly available.
