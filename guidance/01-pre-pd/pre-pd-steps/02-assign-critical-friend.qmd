## What is a Critical Friend?

- Typical DALL initiatives usually involve 1-2 people working on the project.
- For each project a "critical friend" is assigned.
- A critical friend reviews the code and/or business understanding.
- They can also attend meetings, check documents and provide extra support and guidance throughout the initiative.
- Data scientist's assigned the work usually choose a critical friend with input from the DALL team manager.
- The manager knows who is available and has valuable knowledge related to the upcoming project.

## Tips for Working With Your Critical Friend

- Assign a critical friend **as early as possible**.
- Ideally, a critical friend should have prior experience with similar data or techniques.
- The critical friend will help them offer more insight and review the project.
- If you are an initiative expert, you can choose a new team member as the critical friend so they can gain experience.
- Regularly meet with the critical friend to keep them updated.
- Assign work to review in small increments rather than all at once.
- Respect the critical friend's diary and provide plenty of notice for work to be completed.
