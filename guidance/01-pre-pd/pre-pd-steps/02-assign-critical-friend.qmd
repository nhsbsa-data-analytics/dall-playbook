## What is a critical friend?
- Typical DALL initiatives involve 1-2 people working on the project.
- For each project a "critical friend" is assigned.
- A critical friend reviews the code and/or business understanding.
- They can also attend meetings, check documents and provide extra support and guidance throughout the initiative.

## Assigning a critical friend
- Assign a critical friend **as early as possible**.
- Critical friends are assigned by the project members or the DALL team manager.
- The DALL manager knows who is available and has valuable knowledge related to the upcoming project.
- Ideally, a critical friend should have prior experience with similar data or techniques.
- If you are an area expert, you can choose a new team member as the critical friend so they can gain experience.

## Working with your critical friend
- The critical friend will help by offering more insight and reviewing the project.
- Regularly meet with the critical friend to keep them updated.
- Assign work to review in small increments rather than all at once.
- Respect the critical friend's diary and provide plenty of notice for work to be completed.
