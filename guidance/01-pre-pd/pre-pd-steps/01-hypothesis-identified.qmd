The Data Science team deliver [actionable insights](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/data-science-projects) from data through **innovation**, **experimentation** and **collaboration**. The insights drive policy, decision making and efficiencies across the NHSBSA and wider health and social care system. Projects typically align to the following areas:

-	help identify health and care disparities
-	improve patient and customer outcomes 
-	improve employee outcomes
-	reduce loss in the system


## Identifying a problem

-	Projects can be identified by Data Science team members, an internal NHSBSA customer, an external customer or recommendations from previous work.
-	They may also be identified through collaborative ideas sessions we run with other teams.
- Customers can request work through [nhsbsa.dall@nhs.net](mailto:nhsbsa.dall@nhs.net).
- The Data Science Lead reviews projects for suitability in terms of scope and appropriateness, as well as any ethical implications. Projects may be triaged to other teams if not suitable.
-	The Data Science Lead normally assigns initiatives to team members.
-	The Data Science team can log ideas for projects on the ideas register.
