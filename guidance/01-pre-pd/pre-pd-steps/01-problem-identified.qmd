## Identifying a problem
- This could be identified by the DALL team, an internal NHSBSA customer, or an external customer.
- For NHSBSA and external customers, initiatives are logged through [nhsbsa.dall@nhs.net](mailto:nhsbsa.dall@nhs.net) before work begins. 
- The DALL team manager normally assigns initiatives to team members.
- Internal ideas can come from the ideas register, exploratory project, or another source.
- For internal projects the DALL manager acts as the customer.
- External or other internal NHSBSA customers can be assigned if it is within the scope of their role.
