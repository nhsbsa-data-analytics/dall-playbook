## Identify a Problem
This could be identified by the DALL team, an internal NHSBSA customer, or an external customer.

For NHSBSA and external customers, you should log each initiative request through Nhsbsa.dall@nhs.net before starting the work. The DALL team manager normally assigns these initiatives.

Internal ideas can come from the ideas register, exploratory project, or another source. The customer of these initiatives is the DALL team manager unless a customer is found. If you, your critical friend or the DALL team manager has a potential customer in mind, you should setup a meeting with them to explain your ideas and see if they would be interested.
