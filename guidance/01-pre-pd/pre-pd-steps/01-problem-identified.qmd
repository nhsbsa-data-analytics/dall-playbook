This could be identified by the DALL team, an internal NHSBSA customer, or an external customer.

- For NHSBSA and external customers, initiatives are logged through nhsbsa.dall@nhs.net before work begins.

- The DALL team manager normally assigns initiatives to team members.

- Internal ideas can come from the ideas register, exploratory project, or another source.
  - The customer for internal initiatives is the DALL team manager.
  - External or other internal NHSBSA customers can be assigned if it is within the scope of their role.
