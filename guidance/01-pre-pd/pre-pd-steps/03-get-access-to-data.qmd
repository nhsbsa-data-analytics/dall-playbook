## Getting access

If you donâ€™t have access to the data already, you will need to request access.

For the DALP database:

- access to the data needed for each initiative is issued by the DALL data holder and team manager
- send an email to the data holder team manager, specifiying the tables that you need access to
- they will confirm and provide the data from the DALP Oracle database

For the DWCP database:

- you must submit a service request to access the data that you require
- The data may be provided direct from its source (if possible)
- If the data is in DWCP and you think it is worthwhile to have it in DALP, you can request this

Advice on how to request data from both sources can be found within the DALL OneNote Wiki.

## Usage
- Data stored within DALP is typically static.
- Data stored within DWCP is updated on a regular basis.
- If repeating work on a regular basis data stored within DWCP is usually more suitable.
- Take care using DWCP as SQL queries may slow down production systems.
- If data is stored outside of the database it must be stored securely.
- Never store data locally on a laptop.
- Storing data securely in SharePoint is acceptable.

Further advice on usage of DALP and DWCP can be found within the DALL OneNote Wiki.
