## Accessing data

-	Temporary access must be requested via email or a service request and is subject to approval from the Data Science Lead, Database administrators and/or Data Asset Owner.
-	Should sensitive data be needed, there may also be a requirement to engage with the Caldicott Guardian and/or Information Governance.
-	All data must be accessed and processed through the Data Science secure data environment.
-	Also request any relevant metadata, data dictionaries and data quality profiles.


## Initial data understanding

Initial data understanding will help you to understand what is possible with the data including any anomalies, caveats, and quality issues.

-	Use data documentation and identify data SMEs (within the services and/or central MI or Data Services) who will support you to understand what fields are available and their suitability.
-	Initial exploratory data analysis will also help you to get a better feel for the data in terms of its quality and suitability and what data preparation might be required.
- Should documentation not exist, you may wish to record:
  -	a summary of what each column represents
  -	the number of missing records
  -	the number of errors
  -	if applicable, the logic used to calculate the column 


 Combined with business understanding, this initial analysis will help to:

-	inform the problem definition (PD)
-	inform conversations with the customer of what is possible and not possible to achieve during the initiative
-	identify other interesting research questions with the customer and explore if these are worth pursuing
