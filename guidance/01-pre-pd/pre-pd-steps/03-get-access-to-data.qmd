## Getting Access
- If you donâ€™t have access to the data already, you will need request access by email.
- Access to the data needed for each initiative is issued the DALL data holder and team manager.
- They will confirm and provide the data from the DALP Oracle database.
- You can submit a service request to access data not stored within the DALP database.

Advice on how to request data from both sources can be found within the DALL OneNote Wiki.

## Usage
- Data stored within DALP is typically static.
- Data stored within DWCP is updated on a regular basis.
- If repeating work on a regular basis data stored within DWCP is usually more suitable.
- Take care using DWCP as SQL queries may slow down production systems.
- If data is stored outside of the database it must be stored securely.
- Never store data locally on a laptop.
- Storing data securely in SharePoint is acceptable.

Further advice on usage of DALP and DWCP can be found within the DALL OneNote Wiki.
