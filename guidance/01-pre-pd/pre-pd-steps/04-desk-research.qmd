Desk research and business understanding will help you understand what is possible for the initiative and ensure the work is not duplicated.

To assist your work you could use:

-	JIRA as a reference to previous initiatives
-	reports and other outputs from previous initiatives in the project folders 
-	other team members, business SMEs and your critical friend to help develop business knowledge
-	internal and external online resources which may describe the service, policy or other aspects relevant to understanding context
-	externally or internal published statistics, data or dashboards relevant to the subject. They may also later be a source for validation and ensuring coherence.
-	resources to support with methodology such as Github repositories,  Stack Overflow, Medium and research papers 
-	DataCamp to complete relevant courses

This is a guide of what is possible and is dependent on the current projectâ€™s requirements.
