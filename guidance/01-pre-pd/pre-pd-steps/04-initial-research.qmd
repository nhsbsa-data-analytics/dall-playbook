If you have the data, analysing it for insights and limitations will help you understand what is possible for the initiative.

- Use previous initiatives for inspiration.
- JIRA also contains information on previous initiatives.
- Speak to team members and your critical friend to develop business knowledge.
- Use online resources like Stack Overflow and Medium for further inspiration.
- Research papers can be beneficial for technical and machine learning projects.
- Complete relevant DataCamp courses.

This is a guide of what is possible and is dependent on the current project's requirements.
