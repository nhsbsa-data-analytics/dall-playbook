If you have the data, analysing it for insights and limitations will help you understand what is possible for the initiative.

To assist your work you could use:

- previous initiatives for inspiration
- JIRA as a source of information on previous initiatives
- other team members and your critical friend to help develop business knowledge
- online resources like Stack Overflow and Medium for further inspiration
- research papers can be beneficial for technical and machine learning projects
- DataCamp to complete relevant courses

This is a guide of what is possible and is dependent on the current project's requirements.
