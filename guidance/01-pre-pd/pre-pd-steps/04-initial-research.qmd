If you have the data, analysing it for insights and limitations will help you understand what is possible for the initiative.

To assist your work you could use:

- Previous initiatives for inspiration.
- JIRA as a source of information on previous initiatives.
- Other team members and your critical friend to help develop business knowledge.
- Online resources like Stack Overflow and Medium for further inspiration.
- Research papers for technical and machine learning projects.
- DataCamp to complete relevant courses.

This is a guide of what is possible and is dependent on the current project's requirements.
