Before beginning to work on your problem definition, you will need to setup the initiative resources. Currently, these include:

- A JIRA ticket to track progress on the work.
- A SharePoint folder to store documents and data.
- A GitHub repository to store and monitor code.

## Tips for Setting Up the Resources

- Identify the DALL initiative number using JIRA.
- Guidance on setting up resources can be found on the DALL OneNote Wiki.
- Remember to set the new GitHub repository to private.
- Invite all DALL team members as collaborators.
- Code should be written with the intention that it will be made public.
- Be careful not to include PII information within the code- examples include NHS numbers.

After creating all resources, remember to:

- Provide regular updates to the JIRA ticket.
- Regularly push code additions and alterations to the GitHub repository.
