Before beginning to work on your problem definition, you will need to setup the initiative resources. Currently, these include:

- a JIRA ticket to track progress on the work
- a SharePoint folder to store documents and data
- a GitHub repository to store and monitor code

## Setting up the resources
- Identify the Data Science initiative number using JIRA.
- Remember to set the new GitHub repository to private.
- Invite all relevant Data Science team members as collaborators.
- Code should be written with the intention that it will be made public.


Further guidance on setting up resources can be found on the internal Data Science OneNote Wiki. 

After creating all resources, remember to:

- provide regular updates to the JIRA ticket
- regularly push code additions and alterations to the GitHub repository
