Before beginning to work on your problem definition, you will need to setup the initiative resources. Currently, these include:

- a JIRA ticket to track progress on the work
- a SharePoint folder to store documents and data
- a GitHub repository to store and monitor code

## Setting up the resources
- Identify the DALL initiative number using JIRA.
- Remember to set the new GitHub repository to private.
- Invite all DALL team members as collaborators.
- Code should be written with the intention that it will be made public.
- Be careful not to include PII information within the code. Examples include NHS numbers.

Further guidance on setting up resources can be found on the DALL OneNote Wiki. 

After creating all resources, remember to:

- provide regular updates to the JIRA ticket
- regularly push code additions and alterations to the GitHub repository
