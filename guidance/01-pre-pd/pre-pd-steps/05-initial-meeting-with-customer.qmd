It is important to setup a first meeting with the customer once you have developed an initial understanding. During this meeting, you can identify:

- What they are looking to do within the initiative.
- What outputs they are expecting to see, in which format.
- Any business knowledge or insights they can provide to aid your work.
- Any data limitations and possible solutions.
- If there are any additional data sources to be considered.
- The required timescales if applicable.

This meeting is important, as it can help to refine the problem definition within section 2.

## General Considerations

- If the work is particularly urgent, more colleagues and resource can be assigned accordingly.
- Some customers will have busy schedules so it is important to setup the meeting in advance so the project can progress.
- The critical friend should attend the meeting to share knowledge and be clear on the scope of the project.
- Set up recurring follow up meetings at regular intervals.
- Any open questions following the meeting should be chased using either Teams or Email.
