Each publication is assigned a responsible statistician. This is the person who will lead on the development and maintenance of the publication and be the main point of contact for queries about the statistics. Our current publications and responsible statisticians are:

| Publication | Lead statistician |
| --- | - |
| Dependency forming medicines | Kirsty Gray |
| General pharmaceutical services | Kirsty Gray |
| Hormone replacement therapy | Graham Platten |
| Medicines used in mental health --- annual | Kirsty Gray |
| Medicines used in mental health --- quarterly | Grace Libby |
| Prescribing costs in hospitals and the community | Graham Platten |
| Prescribing for diabetes | Kirsty Gray |
| Prescription cost analysis | Graham Platten |

Responsible statisticians are expected to be subject matter experts (SMEs) for the topic areas that they cover.
