This guidance is intended to describe the processes that our publications go 
through to turn data into valuable, high quality, and trustworthy Official 
Statistics. It can be used by statisticians, data analysts, and data scientists 
at the NHSBSA and other organisations who are statistics producers to help guide 
the creation of data products.

## High level process

Each publication will go through the below stages before release. Each stage is 
expanded upon further on in this guidance.
