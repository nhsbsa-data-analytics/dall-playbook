    "text": "Reviewing content\nIn line with the Code of Practice for Statistics, particularly principles V1: Relevance to users and V4: Innovation and improvement, we should always be reviewing the content of our statistics to make sure that they provide public value and meet our user’s needs.\n\nResearch, policy developments and media interests\nAs we begin the production for a new release of a publication the responsible statistician should make sure to familiarise themselves with the content of the publication including the data sources, and their quality, and any policy context/background that we have. A lot can change in the time between releases especially for our prescribing and medicines publications, keeping up to date with policy developments, the release of new prescribing guidance, and what has been in the media is essential. This research should be documented so that it can easily be referenced in the future.\n\n\nUser and stakeholder feedback\nFeedback collected through our continuous surveys, provided via email, or any other route should be reviewed and help guide any changes and improvements that we want to make to the statistics. This could include requests for new analyses, feedback on usability and clarity, or even feedback that an analysis is no longer needed. The views of interested stakeholders should also be regularly sought to make sure that the statistics fulfil their intended purpose. For example, colleagues at the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS England.\n\n\nNew and emerging services\nNew services may become available that would be of interest to include in our publications, for example, a new advanced service for pharmacy contractors or a new service launched by the NHSBSA. Including data and analyses on these new services may provide new insights and increase the value of our statistics.\n\n\nCriteria and SME engagement\nThe criteria for our publications should also be reviewed to make sure that they are still relevant. For example, for publications in specific clinical areas such as Medicines Used in Mental Health and Prescribing for Diabetes the drug lists used should be reviewed and where appropriate the views of clinical colleagues should be sought. New products may have come to market or the BNF classifications of some existing products changed1, We need to make sure that the drug lists that we use are up to date, comprehensive and clinically approved. Subject matter experts (SMEs) should be engaged here to provide guidance.\n\n\nData quality issues\nAs with any data set mistakes can and do happen in our data. To make sure that we are aware of any data quality issues that may impact our statistics the data quality incident register maintained by the Data Governance team should be reviewed. Where a data quality issue is identified this should be noted and steps taken to correct the data or communicated to users what the issue is.\n\n\nIdentified improvements and opportunities\nWe as statisticians often know of improvements that we can make to our outputs to make them more relevant to users or may have seen demonstrations of best practice from across the UK statistical system. During publication retrospectives ideas for improvements to take forward are logged and recorded as part of each publication’s wiki. These ideas should be reviewed and where needed exploratory analysis carried out and documented.\n\n\nMethodological changes\nWe should always be reviewing the methodologies that we use in our statistics to make sure that they are recognised best practice and coherent with other statistics across the health and social care sector. If an improvement to a methodology is identified, for example, calculating standardised population rates or assigning patients to a particular lower-layer super output area (LSOA), then this improvement should be documented alongside any impacts that it may have on the statistics. There is not a dedicated methods group at the NHSBSA, however, other statisticians and analysts in the Data Analytics Learning Lab (DALL) and External Reporting teams should be invited to review the new methodology and discussions held on possible alternatives. Where practicable, all statisticians, data scientists, and analysts across the NHSBSA should be using standardised methods for analysis.\nWhere a new method is statistically innovative or a wholesale change from what has been used before it may be advised to consult the Methodology Advisory Service(MAS) at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\n\nUser engagement and pre-announcing changes\nOnce a review of content has been completed all changes that have been decided to be carried forward for the new release should be documented in full, including additions/removal of content. The impacts of any changes should also be explored and documented, for example, if a methodological change is being made or if a data source is changing. The views of the NHSBSA Lead Official for Statistics and/or Statistical Publication Lead should then be sought on the proposed changes to provide guidance.\nAny changes that we are making to the statistics must be pre-announced on the NHSBSA website well in advance of the release of the statistics (at least 4 weeks in advance). Where practicable, users views should be sought on the proposed changes, but were these changes have been guided by user feedback already this may not be necessary.\nWhere large methodological changes have taken place or where the underlying data source for the statistics has changed and materially impacted new or historical figures users views must be sought before the change is implemented — particularly for National Statistics publications. User engagement can be done through a variety of methods, including:\n\ndedicated engagement events\npublic consultations\nblogs detailing the changes and impacts\nother activities\n\nUser engagement is often done in conjunction with other teams throughout the organisation such as Communications and Customer Insight.

It is important that you dedicate sufficient time to completing this step and remember to treat it as a serious and worthwhile endeavour.\nRemember when using git to work with the mindset that everything committed will be made public. Small and precise commits will make the project clean up easier to complete.\nEven if the code base will not be made public, take the time to clean it up and make sure all branches are committed to main or deleted. Streamlining the codebase is key. Be sure to archive old scripts that are no longer required and to clean up and document the code that is key for the project. If you create a shiny dashboard as an output then your code should already be structured well. If it isn’t consider separating data, scripts and output to separate sub-directories. Ask a member of the DALL team for an example template to follow or look up recent projects on the DALL GitHub page for ideas. If you intend to re-run the code in the future, consider creating a config or preamble script that contains all of the key parameters. For example, if filtering by a date range you can define this range in the config file and reference it throughout the project. This will speed up future work as only a single value needs to be edited for the change to be implemented.\nIf you have key base tables created within DALP make sure these are made available to the wider team so they are not lost. Often the key tables are moved to the DALL_REF schema. At the end of the project make sure to remove any tables. This includes permanent and temporary tables. Once a project concludes you shouldn’t have access to the data anymore."

    "text": "General tips for cleaning your project\nIf you are using Git remember to work with the mindset that everything committed could be made public. Small and precise commits will make the project clean up easier to complete.\nEven if the code base will not be made public, take the time to clean it up and make sure all development branches are committed to main or deleted. Streamlining the codebase is crucial. Be sure to archive old scripts that are no longer required. For the remaining scripts take the time to simplify and document the code. If you create a shiny dashboard as part of the project then your code should already be structured well. If it isn’t consider separating data, scripts and output into separate sub-directories. Remember to check the DALL GitHub page to look up other projects for inspiration.\nIf you have written custom functions it is a good idea to place these into a separate functions script which can then be called later in the project. Be sure to document the functions making it clear what the expected input structure should look like and what each of the parameters correspond to. It is also important to state what the output corresponds to. Including a simple example of how the function works can also be useful but is not mandatory.\nIf you intend to re-run the code in the future, consider creating a config or preamble script. The config script should contain all the key parameters and filters used in the project. For example, if you are filtering by a date range you can define this in the config file and reference it throughout the project. This will speed up future work as only a single value needs editing before the code needs re running.\nCleaning code can be a subjective process. Remember to ask your critical friend for advice if you aren’t sure. When writing code in R a lot of DALL users like to use tidyverse packages. These packages offer direct querying with the database whilst offering a degree of readability. We should always try and find a balance between performance and readability. Code should perform well and run quickly but also be understood by colleagues. It should be noted that you are not constrained to use tidyverse packages. But keeping in mind readability with well commented code will improve your project.\nIf you have key base tables created within DALP make sure these are made available to the wider team. That way if you are away on annual leave or unavailable they are not lost. Often the key tables are moved to the DALL_REF schema. At the end of the project make sure to remove any tables that you have created. This includes permanent and temporary tables. Once a project concludes you shouldn’t have access to the data anymore, especially if it has personal information included."

The README file should contain as a minimum the project name, and a quick overview of the project’s purpose. It can also be valuable to include a summary of the project structure, steps to reproduce your code locally and a description of the key technologies and methods used. A clean and informative README will make it more likely someone will use your code and will make it easier for future users to understand your project.\nRemember to document anything that you tried that did not work.

    "text": "Not all Github repositories will be made public. But if you need to make it public then there are a few things you should consider:\n\nYour git commit history will be made public. Although commit messages can be changed it is advised that you adopt a good commit practice throughout. Try to limit each commit to a single change and not large chunks of code.\nMake sure that you never push data or PID to the GitHub repository. An easy example of something that could be overlooked is an NHS number. If you test a chunk of code by looking at a single individual it is easy for the NHS number to be forgotten about. It’s even easier to miss if the PID is part of some test code that has been commented out. Using something like Git Leaks is a useful tool to help capture some of these subtle examples and minimise the risk of uploading personal information to GitHub.\n\nMore information on creating a public Github repository can be found on the DALL Wiki (Coding & Dashboards &gt; GitHub &gt; DALL standard practice)."
