Introduction.\n2. Contents.\n3. Key findings (since some may not have time to read the whole content).\n4. Assumptions and limitations.\n5. Your findings.\n6. Recommendations and next steps.\n7. Appendices (if applicable).\n\n## Supporting text\nMost outputs will feature at least some text. General tips for writing includes:\n\n- putting the key findings at the front as people won't read the whole thing\n- including caveats and assumptions, and for particularly important ones mention them up front\n- writing numbers under 10 as words, over 10 in digits (but use common sense!)\n- using bold tag lines for emphasis of important points\n- developing an interesting narrative (sometimes difficult to do)\n- if appropriate, including recommendations and ideas for further exploration\n- writing sentences shorter than 20 words\n- writing so that a 12 year old would be able to understand it, assume readers are non-technical\n- if multiple people have contributed text, assigning one person in the final stages to act as an editor and rewrite in a single style\n- leaving the writing of any text that supports visuals such as charts or tables until the team is almost certain they are finalised\n\nThere are pages on initiative outputs with specific format advice in the internal DALL Wiki. A very useful tool for written output is [Hemingway Editor](https://hemingwayapp.com/). If you can get your text to mostly have no issues in this, you know it is readable!\n\n## Slide decks\nAll initiatives should have at least two slide decks as an agreed output. One of these is for the customer, the other is designed to be quickly presented to interested parties.\n\n### Customer summary\nThis is to give the customer an easily shared and concise report on the outcomes of an initiative. The summary should:\n\n- state the problems or questions the initiative looked at, with examples\n- give the most important assumptions or caveats, and if appropriate issues encountered\n- summarise the most important findings\n- give brief recommendations and next steps\n- provide a mix of visuals and text, with more text preferred.\n- use technical language, if you think the customer is familiar with it\n\n### Short presentation\nThis is intended to be used by the DALL team to present to others. It also serves as a quick reference of the outcome of an initiative, helpful to people looking back at it in future.\n\nA good presentation will:\n\n- show examples of the why the initiative was done\n- give assumptions and caveats only if absolutely necessary to prevent a major misunderstanding\n- summarise the most important findings\n- give brief recommendations and next steps\n- limit the amounts of explanatory text and make the most of visuals\n- use animations\n- take around 10 minutes to present (depending on situation)\n- assume audience is non-technical\n- focus on up to three findings that you would like the audience to remember (applicable for large initiatives with lots of components and findings)\n- use a good presentation style such as the [newsreader style](https://www.revolutionlearning.co.uk/article/newsreader-style-presentation-structure/)\n- have an up to date final slide containing feedback and use cases\n- give people the opportunity to provide feedback- if you are not getting feedback 'organically', reach out to get enough for at least one slide!\n\n## Accessibility concerns\nIf your output is to be available online, it must be tested for accessibility and include (or link to) an Accessibility Statement. Full details are in the DALL Wiki.\n\n- Try to create outputs with accessibility in mind; for example using the `{shiny}` [template](https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/nhsbsaShinyR).\n- Don't test for accessibility too early; do it only once reasonably confident the non-text output is finalised.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"03-reporting-and-visuals.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en-GB","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","pagetitle":"NHSBSA DALL Playbook","theme":"cosmo","mainfont":"Arial","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Reporting and visuals","description":"Draft reports, slide decks, data sets, applications and any other agreed outputs.","image":"03-reporting-and-visuals.jpg","image-alt":"Photo by Stephen Dawson on Unsplash"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
