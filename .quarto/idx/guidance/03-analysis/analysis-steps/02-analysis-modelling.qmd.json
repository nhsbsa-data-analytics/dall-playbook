The work done here can vary. It can include small data extraction jobs, creating reports and dashboards, and deploying machine learning models. The analysis or modelling you conduct is also heavily reliant on the outputs you agreed with the customer.\n\nStarting from the base tables, we want to create the agreed outputs. Depending on the work, there are many tools we can use to do this. \n\n- R is especially suited to use for data analysis and visualisation, via Rmarkdown and Shiny.\n- Python has most widespread support for machine learning and is more widely integrated with cloud based platforms.\n- Power BI is a possible alternative to R for creating dashboards, but due to licensing may not be suitable for certain end users.\n- If it is appropriate, such as needing to show simple summary statistics, Excel and/or SQL can be used.\n\nPlease see the DALL wiki for tips on how to use all of these tools.\n\n## Tips for effective analysis\n- Use Github to handle version control, issues and code reviews.\n- In Python, use object-oriented programming (OOP) if you can. \n- Although R does have support for OOP, it is not a big paradigm like in Python.\n- Be careful of premature optimisation (called out by computer scientist Donald Knuth as 'the root of all evil' in software development).\n- Start small, such as limiting data to some subset when developing metrics; this makes it easier to spot issues and allows for faster iteration of code.\n- Check the data looks correct at each step of transforming it; better still, know what it _should_ be before writing and applying the step (the principle behind test driven development, TDD).\n- Work on one component of output at a time, for example using `{shiny}` modules as in our [template](https://github.com/nhsbsa-data-analytics/nhsbsaShinyR).\n- Frequently run code as you write it, so any issues are encountered early and their source is clearer.\n- You may produce multiple smaller data sets to be used in your outputs; the considerations applying to base tables apply equally to these.\n- The final code should use RAP principles [LINK?].\n\n## Check the quality\nAs with data preparation, it's important to test and validate your results. \n\n- Where possible, check results against other sources.\n- Other sources could be data from previous initiatives, Management Information dashboards or ePACT2.\n\nAdditionally, you must be careful about visualising sensitive results.
