There are multiple layers of review:\n\n- Self Review\n- Team Review\n- Critical Friend Review\n- Customer Review\n\nIn response to any one of these reviews, it may be deemed necessary to go back to data preparation, analysis or drafting of outputs.\n\nReview your own work as you go, but especially before requesting anyone else to review it. Before submitting for review you should:\n\n- check for errors\n- run code with a 'clean slate' to ensure there are no dependencies in your local environment that will not be there later\n- consider writing repeatable tests rather than adhoc testing\n- document your code\n- create a pull request (PR) on Github once happy with the code\n- check the code diff (difference) on Github and add comments to explain to a code reviewer any decisions you made that are not obvious\n- check the code diff as it may highlight something you missed; in these cases make further changes and push them\n- make sure each PR contains only small changes\n\nOnce happy with your PR, request that someone code review it.\n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Give colleagues sufficient time\"}\n<div>\n  <p> Remember that your colleagues have other work; give them enough time to review your work properly.</p>\n\n</div>\n:::\n\n## Team review\nOne or more other members of the initiative team should review all code and outputs before it is merged into the main branch.\n\nThe reviewers should:\n\n- pull the code into their local environment, and run it from a 'blank slate' state\n- add comments and suggestions to the PR\n- check any outputs match what was agreed in the problem definition\n- ask the code author to clarify if something does not make sense\n- organise a call with the code author and work through the PR together if several questions arise\n\n## Critical friend review\nThe initiative critical friend (CF) should:\n\n- be asked for feedback on work in progress at frequent intervals, and always before asking a customer to look at it\n- put themselves in the shoes of the customer when reviewing outputs\n- put themselves in the shoes of someone tasked with using the code base when reviewing code\n- arrange a call with the initiative team to discuss if the feedback is complex or if there is lots of it\n\n## Customer review\nThe customer should be given frequent opportunities to see work in progress. To do this you should:\n\n- send them drafts of the outputs to review in their own time, rather than only sharing your screen in a call\n- be open to having calls once they have reviewed the work\n- discuss any questions or suggestions they have\n\nWhen you feel the initiative is completed, you should have a call with the customer to present your findings and:\n\n- ensure the customer is happy they understand how to use any interactive elements, such as dashboards\n- discuss any potential for future related work\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"04-review.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en-GB","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","pagetitle":"NHSBSA DALL Playbook","theme":"cosmo","mainfont":"Arial","page-layout":"full","title-block-banner":true,"title":"Review","description":"Reviews of the code and outputs by yourself, the team, critical friend and customer before wrapping up the initiative.","image":"04-review.jpg","image-alt":"Photo by Clay Banks on Unsplash"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
